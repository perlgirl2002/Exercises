1.   The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign.

In order to best determine which product should be featured in their new advertising campaign, I would first 
get the webpage associated with the highest activity, then get the webpage/product associated with the highest pageviews, and finally, get the product with the maximum purchases.  For each product, I would calculate the percentage of conversions.  Using all of this information, I would likely try to discover the feature with the highest correlation to purchasing and use that one as the feature product.

2. Signups have slowed, and you are tasked with finding out why. 

First, I would try to find any correlation (decline in signups is directly correlated with a decline in marketing spend per week).  I would develop a diagram showing progression through each step of the onboarding funnel so identify any significant declines from one step to another.  I would see if any step had a significant increase of time (it takes longer, therefore people stop signing up) in any particular step over the last 3 years.  

3.  You are tasked with proposing a better ranking system. 

This one is rather difficult.  THe question does not provide enough information to get to a logical conclusion; specifically, develop a "better ranking system".  Better compared to what?  Compared to how many hotel rooms were booked?  How long people stayed on a page?  Whether the users liked what they saw better and resulted in more positive feedback?  There must be something to judge it by.

4.  Churn

I would perform trend analysis on the timestamped data for users, baseline it, and identify any anomalous churn events over the past 3 years.
